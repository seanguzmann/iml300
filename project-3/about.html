                <span class="bold-text">THE THIRD CINEMA PROJECT</span> is a digital archive dedicated exclusively to lost and under-distributed Afro-Latino and Black independent films from the latter half of the 20th century through the present day and into the future. Doubly, this site serves as a spiritual space to honor the artists who created this lost media and were systematically erased by the mainstream industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                While practices of collecting and archiving are celebrated and heralded as feats of excellence, the notion of erasure looms in the shadows. This archive cannot exist without the erasure of the very things it houses. With this ethos, the project aims to challenge viewers to consider a few different things: (i) why has this material been erased, (ii) what does it mean that someone found it worthy to preserve, and (iii) how do we prevent future erasure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you are a historian, archivist, filmmaker, cinephile, or casual enjoyer of cinema, there is a purpose for you here. Indulge in lost history and celebrate those who dared to tell stories that oppressors saw worthy of condemnation. Thank you for visiting.
